## Phase 1: Database Setup (Supabase)

### Step 1: Run SQL Migrations
- [ ] Open Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy entire content from `SUPABASE_SETUP_SESSION8.sql`
- [ ] Paste into SQL Editor
- [ ] Click "Run" button
- [ ] Verify all functions created without errors
- [ ] Verify tables created: `employee_approvals`, `approval_history`
- [ ] Verify functions created: 4 new PL/pgSQL functions

### Step 2: Verify RLS Policies
- [ ] Check `employee_approvals` table has RLS enabled
- [ ] Check `approval_history` table has RLS enabled
- [ ] Verify 5 new RLS policies created
- [ ] Test policies with sample data

### Step 3: Enable Real-time
- [ ] Open Supabase Dashboard → Replication
- [ ] Verify `employee_approvals` is in publication
- [ ] Verify `approval_history` is in publication
- [ ] Verify `employees` table is in publication
- [ ] Verify `users` table is in publication

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
```

## Phase 4: Testing

### Scenario 1: Basic Approval Workflow

```
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Super-Admin Dashboard
3. See pending employees
4. Select "hr" from role dropdown
5. Click "Approve"
6. Verify employee is removed from list
7. Check database: employees.role should be "hr"
8. Check database: employees.status should be "active"
9. Check database: approval_history should have 1 record
```

**Verification Queries:**
```sql
-- Check employee was updated
SELECT id, role, status FROM employees WHERE id = '<employee-id>';

-- Check approval history
SELECT * FROM approval_history WHERE employee_id = '<employee-id>';

-- Check approval request
SELECT * FROM employee_approvals WHERE employee_id = '<employee-id>';
```

### Scenario 2: Role-Based Access Control

```
1. Log in as employee
2. Try to access /admin/super-admin
3. Should be denied/redirected
4. Log in as admin
5. Should have full access
6. Log in as super-admin
7. Should have full access
```

### Scenario 3: Real-time Updates

```
1. Open browser window A: /admin/super-admin
2. Open browser window B: /admin/super-admin
3. In window A: Approve an employee
4. In window B: Within 5 seconds, should see update
5. Verify both windows show same pending count
```

### Scenario 4: Rejection Workflow

```
1. Click "Reject" on pending employee
2. Enter rejection reason
3. Submit
4. Verify employee appears in rejection view (if implemented)
5. Check database: employees.status should be "rejected"
```

### Scenario 5: Approval History

```
1. Click eye icon on employee
2. Should see history entries
3. For each entry verify:
   - Old role
   - New role
   - Approver name and role
   - Timestamp
   - Reason (if provided)
```

---

## Phase 5: Database Verification

### Run Verification Queries

```sql
-- 1. Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('employee_approvals', 'approval_history');

-- 2. Check functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name LIKE 'approve_%' OR routine_name LIKE 'update_employee%';

-- 3. Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('employee_approvals', 'approval_history');

-- 4. Check indexes
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'employee_approvals' OR tablename = 'approval_history';

-- 5. Test function call (as service role)
SELECT * FROM approve_employee_with_role(
  '<employee-id>',
  'admin',
  '<approver-id>',
  'Test Admin',
  'Test reason'
);
```
