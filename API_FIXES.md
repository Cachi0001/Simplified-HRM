# API Communication Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve the API communication issues in the Go3net HR Management System.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Your session has expired" Message During Login

**Problem**: Users were seeing "Your session has expired" error messages when trying to log in, which was confusing since they weren't even logged in yet.

**Fix**: Updated the error handling in the API client to properly identify login attempts and prevent showing session expiration messages during login. The system now correctly shows "Please verify your email address before logging in" for unverified accounts.

### 2. "Failed to fetch" Error During Email Confirmation

**Problem**: Users were seeing "Failed to fetch" errors when trying to confirm their email addresses.

**Fix**: 
- Updated the ConfirmEmail component to use the API client instead of direct fetch calls
- Added proper error handling for different types of responses
- Implemented request tracking with unique IDs for better debugging
- Added timeout handling to prevent indefinite loading

### 3. TypeScript Error with requestId Property

**Problem**: There was a TypeScript error because we added the `requestId` property but didn't properly extend the Axios types:
```
Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. Property 'config' must be of type 'InternalAxiosRequestConfig<D>', but here has type 'InternalAxiosRequestConfig<any>'.ts(2717)
```

**Fix**: Added proper TypeScript declarations to extend the Axios types with our custom properties:

```typescript
// Before
declare module 'axios' {
  export interface InternalAxiosRequestConfig {
    requestId?: string;
  }
  
  export interface AxiosResponse {
    config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig;
  }
}

// After
declare module 'axios' {
  export interface InternalAxiosRequestConfig<D = any> {
    requestId?: string;
  }
  
  export interface AxiosResponse<T = any, D = any> {
    config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig<D>;
  }
}
```

### 4. MongoDB Connection Issues

**Problem**: The backend was configured to use a local MongoDB instance, but the actual database was in MongoDB Atlas.

**Fix**: Updated the MongoDB connection string in the backend .env file to use the correct MongoDB Atlas URI.

### 5. CORS Issues

**Problem**: There were potential CORS issues preventing communication between the frontend and backend.

**Fix**: Updated the CORS settings in the backend to accept requests from all origins during development.

## Technical Details

### API Client Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added specific handling for email verification errors
   - Prevented showing session expiration messages during login
   - Added detailed error logging with unique error IDs

2. **Request Tracking**:
   - Added unique request IDs to all API requests
   - Implemented consistent logging with request IDs
   - Added request timeout handling

3. **Response Handling**:
   - Added proper content-type checking for responses
   - Implemented specific handling for non-JSON responses
   - Added detailed error messages for different types of errors

### Email Confirmation Process

1. **API Client Integration**:
   - Updated to use the centralized API client instead of direct fetch calls
   - Added proper error handling for different response types
   - Implemented request tracking with unique IDs

2. **AuthService Integration**:
   - Added methods for email confirmation and resending confirmation emails
   - Implemented proper error handling for authentication operations
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

### Configuration Updates

1. **MongoDB Connection**:
   - Updated to use MongoDB Atlas instead of local MongoDB
   - Configured proper connection string with authentication

2. **CORS Settings**:
   - Added wildcard origin for development
   - Ensured all frontend origins are allowed

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. **Login Process**:
   - Try logging in with an unverified email - you should see "Please verify your email address before logging in"
   - Try logging in with incorrect credentials - you should see "Invalid email or password"

2. **Email Confirmation**:
   - Click the confirmation link in your email
   - The confirmation should work without "Failed to fetch" errors
   - If there are any issues, detailed error messages should be shown

3. **Password Reset**:
   - Try resetting your password
   - The process should work without any "Failed to fetch" errors

## Future Improvements

1. Implement similar robust error handling in other parts of the application
2. Add more comprehensive logging on the backend to match the detailed frontend logs
3. Consider implementing a centralized error tracking system to collect and analyze errors
4. Add automated tests specifically for error handling scenarios
