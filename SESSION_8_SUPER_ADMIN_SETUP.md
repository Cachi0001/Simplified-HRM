# SESSION 8: Super-Admin Dashboard & Employee Role Approval System

## Overview

This session implements a comprehensive role-based employee approval system with a Super-Admin dashboard, enabling real-time approval of employees with role assignment for admin, HR, and super-admin roles.

## Requirements Delivered

✅ **Super-Admin Role Support** - Added to all models and database
✅ **Employee Approval Workflow** - Approve → Select Role → Assign
✅ **Role Assignment Endpoint** - `/employees/:id/approve-with-role`
✅ **Role Update Endpoint** - `/employees/:id/update-role`
✅ **Approval History Tracking** - Full audit trail of all changes
✅ **Super-Admin Dashboard** - React component for managing approvals
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Supabase RLS policies and triggers
✅ **Supabase Functions** - All business logic in database layer

## Database Setup

### 1. Run SQL Queries

Execute the queries in this order:

```bash
# File: SUPABASE_SETUP_SESSION8.sql
# Steps:
# 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
# 2. Copy entire SQL file content
# 3. Run the queries
# 4. Verify each table is created
```

### Key Tables Created

1. **employee_approvals** - Tracks pending/approved/rejected requests
2. **approval_history** - Audit trail of all role changes

### Key Functions Created

1. `approve_employee_with_role()` - Approve employee with role assignment
2. `update_employee_role()` - Update employee role directly (admin/super-admin)
3. `get_pending_approvals()` - Retrieve pending approvals for current user
4. `reject_employee_request()` - Reject employee request with reason

## Backend Configuration

2. **Admin/HR/Super-Admin Can View All**
   - Any admin, HR, or super-admin can view all pending approvals

3. **Admin/HR/Super-Admin Can Update**
   - Full CRUD permissions for admins, HR, and super-admins

### approval_history Table

1. **View Own History**
   - Employees can view their own role change history

2. **Admin/HR/Super-Admin Can View All**

## Real-time Features

### Realtime Subscriptions

The following tables have realtime enabled:
- `employee_approvals`
- `approval_history`
- `employees`
- `users`

### Usage Example

```tsx
import { useRealtimeApprovals } from './hooks/useRealtimeApprovals';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { approvals, loading } = useRealtimeApprovals();
  
  return (
    // Component using real-time approvals
  );
};
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin Approving Employee as HR

```
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Super-Admin Dashboard
3. See pending employees
4. Select "hr" from dropdown
5. Click "Approve"
6. Verify status changes to "active"
7. Verify user.role updated in database
```

### Scenario 2: HR Rejecting Request

```
1. Log in as HR
2. Go to Super-Admin Dashboard (if accessible)
3. Click "Reject" on pending employee
4. Enter reason: "Not qualified for admin role"
5. Submit
6. Verify employee status = "rejected"
7. Verify history entry created
```

### Scenario 3: Real-time Updates

```
1. Have two browser windows open
2. Window A: Super-Admin Dashboard
3. Window B: Another Super-Admin Dashboard
4. In Window B: Approve an employee
5. In Window A: Should see removal/update in real-time (within 5 seconds)
```

### Scenario 4: Role Change Audit Trail

```
1. Create employee → status: pending, role: employee
2. Admin approves as HR → status: active, role: hr
3. Super-Admin updates to admin → status: active, role: admin
4. View history: Should show 2 entries
   - Entry 1: employee → hr (by admin)
   - Entry 2: hr → admin (by super-admin)
```

## Security Considerations

### RLS Policies

✅ Employees cannot approve themselves
✅ Employees cannot view other's pending requests
✅ HR cannot assign admin role
✅ Only admin/super-admin can directly update roles
✅ All changes are audited in approval_history

### Backend Validation

- Role values validated on every endpoint
- User role checked before operations
- Approver role verified (admin/hr/super-admin only)
- Error messages don't leak user information

### Frontend Protection

- Role dropdown only shows valid options
- Buttons disabled during API calls
- Loading states prevent double-submission
- Error messages shown to user

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthorized: Only admin, HR, or super-admin can approve"

**Solution:** 
- Verify user's role in employees table
- Check that user_id matches in both users and employees tables

### Issue: "Employee not found"

**Solution:**
- Verify employee_id exists in employees table
- Check that user_id relationship is correct

### Issue: Approval history not showing

**Solution:**
- Verify approval_history table exists
- Check RLS policies are correct
- Ensure user role allows viewing history

### Issue: Real-time updates not working

**Solution:**
- Verify Supabase realtime is enabled
- Check that tables are added to supabase_realtime publication
- Verify browser WebSocket connection

## Performance Notes

1. **Database Queries**
   - Indexed on: employee_id, status, role, created_at
   - Functions use efficient RPC calls

2. **Frontend Refreshing**
   - Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
   - Can be adjusted based on performance needs
   - Consider implementing WebSocket subscriptions for true real-time

3. **History Display**
   - Limited to 100 records per employee
   - Can add pagination if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Enhancement**
   - Add WebSocket subscriptions for true real-time
   - Add filtering/search in dashboard
   - Add bulk operations

2. **Backend Enhancement**
   - Add email notifications on approval
   - Add notification history tracking
   - Add webhook support for external systems

3. **Additional Features**
   - Multi-approver workflow
   - Role delegation (admins can delegate to HR)
   - Approval templates
   - Batch operations
