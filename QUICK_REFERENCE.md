## Environment Setup

Nothing new to configure! Existing settings work:

```env
# Already configured:
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=onyemechicaleb4@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=vapmmsbaootvgtau
FROM_EMAIL=kayode@go3net.com.ng
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Update FRONTEND_URL for production:
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomian.com
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?
1. Check SMTP credentials in `.env`
2. Check logs: `✅ Task notification email sent successfully`
3. Check email junk/spam folder

### React key warning still showing?
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear cache in DevTools
3. Check both `AdminDepartments.tsx` and `AdminTasks.tsx` updated

### Button not showing loading spinner?
1. Verify `isPending` from mutation is passed
2. Check Button.tsx has `isLoading` prop support (✅ already there)

### Email links not working?
1. Check `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
2. Verify app is accessible at that URL
3. Test link format: `http://domain.com/auth/login`
