# HR Management System - Development Summary
## October 26, 2025

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. **Employee Login Issue**
**Problem**: Approved employees (status: active) were still receiving "pending approval" messages during login.

**Root Cause**: Backend was checking email verification status instead of just employee approval status.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/repositories/implementations/SupabaseAuthRepository.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/auth/LoginCard.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed email verification checks from login logic
- Backend now only validates `employee.status === 'active'`
- Enhanced logging for debugging login process
- Clear cached data on login failure

#### 2. **Password Reset CORS Issues**
**Problem**: "Failed to fetch" errors with double slash URLs during password reset.

**Root Cause**: URL construction issues and CORS configuration problems.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- `frontend/src/services/authService.ts`
- `backend/src/server.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed API base URL construction to prevent double slashes
- Enhanced CORS configuration with specific password reset handling
- Added URL normalization in axios interceptors
- Added OPTIONS handlers for password reset routes

#### 3. **Database Schema and Foreign Key Issues**
**Problem**: Foreign key constraint violations when creating tasks.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between user IDs in different tables.

**Files Modified**:
- Database schema and relationships
- Task creation logic

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed user ID references in task creation
- Added proper foreign key constraints

#### 4. **Authentication Flow Improvements**
**Problem**: Complex authentication logic causing confusion.

**Root Cause**: Multiple verification steps and unclear approval process.

**Files Modified**:
- Backend authentication controllers and services
- Frontend login components

**Changes Made**:
- Simplified login to only check employee approval status
- Removed email verification requirements for active employees
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### Current Status

✅ **Completed Fixes**:
- Password reset CORS issues resolved
- URL construction fixed
- Enhanced logging implemented
- Database foreign key issues addressed

⚠️ **Remaining Issues**:
- Employee login still showing approval messages (backend may not be updated)
- Task creation foreign key constraint errors

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy Latest Backend Changes**: The backend needs to be rebuilt and redeployed with the login fixes
2. **Test Employee Login**: Verify that approved employees can now login without approval messages
3. **Test Password Reset**: Confirm CORS issues are resolved
4. **Fix Task Creation**: Address the foreign key constraint issue in task creation

### Files Modified Summary
