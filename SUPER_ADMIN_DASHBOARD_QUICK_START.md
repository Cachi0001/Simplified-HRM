## 🧮 Statistics Explained

| Card | Shows | Updates When |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Pending Approvals | Count of unapproved employees | Employee approved/rejected |
| Total Employees | All employees in system | New employee added |
| Admins | Count with admin role | Employee promoted to admin |
| HR Staff | Count with hr role | Employee promoted to HR |

**Formula**:
```
Admins = Number of pending employees with role = 'admin'
HR Staff = Number of pending employees with role = 'hr'
Pending = Total unapproved employees in queue
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Auto-Refresh Interval
**Default**: 5 seconds

**To Change** (in SuperAdminDashboard.tsx):
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(loadPendingApprovals, 5000); // ← Change 5000 to desired ms
```
