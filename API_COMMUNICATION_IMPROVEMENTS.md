# API Communication Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the API communication layer in the Go3net HR Management System, focusing on fixing the "Failed to fetch" errors and ensuring all endpoints communicate properly with the backend.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced API Client

- **Request Tracking**: Added unique request IDs to all API requests for better debugging and tracing
- **Response Content Type Handling**: Improved handling of different response content types, especially for non-JSON responses
- **Detailed Error Logging**: Enhanced error logging with structured information and unique error IDs
- **Timeout Management**: Added specific timeout handling for critical operations like password reset

### 2. Password Reset Flow

- **Centralized Service**: Updated the password reset flow to use the centralized `authService` instead of direct fetch calls
- **Proper Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for the password reset process
- **Request Tracking**: Implemented request tracking with unique IDs for debugging
- **Session Storage**: Added session storage to persist information across page refreshes

### 3. JSON Parsing Improvements

- **Content Type Checking**: Added proper content-type checking before attempting to parse responses as JSON
- **HTML Response Handling**: Added specific handling for HTML responses that might be returned instead of JSON
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Improved error messages for JSON parsing failures with clear, actionable information
- **Response Preview Logging**: Added logging of response previews for debugging purposes

### 4. Authentication Flow

- **Token Management**: Enhanced token management for authentication requests
- **Session Expiration Handling**: Improved handling of session expiration with clear user messages
- **Duplicate Message Prevention**: Added prevention for duplicate error messages

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Enhanced the API client with better error handling and request tracking
2. `frontend/src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx` - Updated to use the API client and authService
3. `frontend/src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordCard.tsx` - Improved error handling and added request tracking
4. `frontend/src/services/authService.ts` - Added a new method for completing password reset

## Technical Details

### Request Tracking

Each API request now has a unique ID that follows this format:
- Regular requests: `req_[timestamp]_[random]`
- Password reset requests: `reset_[timestamp]_[random]`
- Forgot password requests: `forgot_[timestamp]_[random]`

This allows for better debugging and tracing of requests through the system.

### Error Handling Improvements

The API client now handles different types of errors more gracefully:

1. **Network Errors**: Better messages for connection issues
2. **JSON Parsing Errors**: Specific handling for invalid JSON responses
3. **Authentication Errors**: Clear messages for authentication failures
4. **Server Errors**: Friendly messages for server-side issues

### Content Type Handling

The API client now checks the content type of responses before attempting to parse them as JSON. This prevents the "Unexpected token" errors that were occurring when HTML was returned instead of JSON.

## Testing

To verify these improvements:

1. Test the "Forgot Password" flow by entering your email
2. Check that you receive a success message
3. Click the link in the email you receive
4. Enter a new password and confirm it
5. Verify that you can log in with the new password

If any issues occur, check the browser console for detailed error logs with request IDs that can help identify the problem.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement similar robust error handling in other parts of the application
2. Add more comprehensive logging on the backend to match the detailed frontend logs
3. Consider implementing a centralized error tracking system to collect and analyze errors
4. Add automated tests specifically for error handling scenarios
