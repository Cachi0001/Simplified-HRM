## üë• Role Access Control

### Employee Role
```javascript
Can do:
‚úÖ Edit own profile (personal info only)
‚úÖ Change own password
‚úÖ Configure notifications
‚úÖ Set preferences
‚úÖ View own department

Cannot do:
‚ùå Edit department assignment
‚ùå See other employees
‚ùå Approve requests
‚ùå View system settings
```

### HR Role
```javascript
Can do:
‚úÖ Edit own profile (all fields)
‚úÖ Assign departments to employees
‚úÖ Approve leave requests
‚úÖ Approve purchase requests
‚úÖ View employee attendance
‚úÖ Change own password
‚úÖ Configure notifications

Cannot do:
‚ùå Create/delete users
‚ùå Change system settings
‚ùå Edit admin profiles
```

### Admin Role
```javascript
Can do:
‚úÖ View all system data
‚úÖ Configure system settings
‚úÖ Change all passwords (with confirmation)
‚úÖ Configure notifications
‚úÖ Set preferences

Restricted:
‚ö†Ô∏è Own profile editing disabled (for security)
‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot edit own email/department
‚ö†Ô∏è Must use SQL for critical changes
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. Admin Profile Protection
- Admin accounts cannot edit their own profile through UI
- Prevents accidental changes to critical accounts
- Requires direct SQL or system admin panel

### 2. Role Validation
- All endpoints must validate user role
- HR cannot approve their own requests
- Admins cannot be converted to other roles through UI

### 3. Permission Checks
- HR permissions stored in separate table
- Granular control over HR capabilities
- Can revoke specific permissions without changing role

### 4. Data Privacy
- Preferences stored client-side (localStorage)
- Sensitive data never logged
- Push tokens encrypted in database

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Set Up Navigation First
Add Settings link to Header/BottomNavbar before deployment. Helps users discover the feature.

### Tip 2: Convert Team Leads First
Convert team leads to HR role first. They can then help manage the rest of the team.

### Tip 3: Monitor Dark Mode
Track dark mode usage via analytics. Can help with UI/UX decisions.

### Tip 4: Backup Before Migration
Always backup database before running migrations. Use Supabase built-in backup.

### Tip 5: Test on Real Data
Test settings page with real employee data, not just test accounts.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I rename departments?**
A: Yes, update COMMON_DEPARTMENTS array in AdminDepartments.tsx

**Q: What if I want more than 10 departments?**
A: Add to COMMON_DEPARTMENTS array and create in departments table

**Q: Can employees change their own department?**
A: No, only HR and Admin can. Prevents conflicts with assignments.

**Q: Are preferences synced across devices?**
A: No, stored locally. Backend storage is next phase optimization.

**Q: Can I delete HR permissions table?**
A: Yes, but need to handle missing permissions in code gracefully.

**Q: What happens if I delete an HR user?**
A: All their permissions auto-delete (cascading delete).
