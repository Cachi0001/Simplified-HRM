# Task Completion Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Geolocation Re-prompt Issue ✅
- **Problem**: When location access was denied, there was no re-prompt functionality
- **Solution**: Modified `EmployeeAttendance.tsx` to:
  - Add state tracking for location denial
  - Add a retry button that re-triggers geolocation request
  - Improve error messages to be more user-friendly
  - Updated error message from "Location not available" to "You must allow location access to check in."

### 2. Error Message Updates ✅
- **Problem**: Backend returned "Employee is already checked in today"
- **Solution**: Updated `MongoAttendanceRepository.ts` to return "You have already checked in." instead

### 3. Login Toast and Page Refresh Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Double toast messages and page refresh when employees tried to login with unapproved accounts
- **Solution**: Modified API interceptor in `api.ts` to:
  - Properly handle 403 status codes for pending approval cases
  - Prevent showing "Session expired" messages for approval-related errors
  - Allow the login form to show appropriate warning messages without redirecting

### 4. Push Notification Fix ✅
- **Problem**: When admin approved employee accounts, notifications went to admin instead of employee
- **Solution**: Updated notification service logic to:
  - Allow employees to receive their own approval notifications
  - Modified employee notification fetching to check approval status and show welcome messages
  - Added proper notification filtering based on user roles and target users

### 5. Location Prompt Issue ✅
- **Problem**: After denying location access, clicking check-in again didn't show browser prompt
- **Solution**: Fixed geolocation handling with proper state management and retry functionality

### 6. Attendance Report Page ✅
- **Problem**: Needed "View More" link on attendance cards to navigate to detailed report
- **Solution**:
  - Created new `AttendanceReportPage.tsx` with full dashboard branding
  - Added "View More" link in `EmployeeAttendance.tsx` attendance history section
  - Added proper routing in `App.tsx`
  - Included dark mode toggle, proper contrast, and consistent styling

### 7. Navigation Updates ✅
- **Problem**: Navbar didn't show current page when on attendance report
- **Solution**: Updated `BottomNavbar.tsx` to:
  - Show attendance icon as active when on `/attendance-report` page
  - Handle navigation properly for the new attendance report page

### 8. Dashboard Styling ✅
- **Problem**: Ensure new attendance report page follows dashboard design patterns
- **Solution**: AttendanceReportPage includes:
  - Logo and consistent header design
  - Dark mode toggle functionality
  - Proper contrast and theming
  - Consistent card layouts and spacing
  - Bottom navigation integration

### 10. Attendance Report Page Fixes ✅
- **Problem**: Attendance page only fetching 2 records, not showing proper status (Active/Completed), not showing last 5 days by default
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed status display to use `record.status` field from backend instead of determining from check-out time
  - Added default 5-day date range when no filters are applied
  - Updated both AttendanceReportPage and AdminAttendance components for consistency
  - Fixed CSV export to use proper status field
  - Updated headers to indicate "Last 5 Days" default view

4. **Navigation**: Test clicking "View More" link navigates to attendance report
5. **Attendance Report**: Test default 5-day view, status display (Active/Completed), and CSV export
