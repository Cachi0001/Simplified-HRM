## 🔒 Security Notes

✅ **Secure by default:**
- Only Admin and HR can access role management
- HR cannot promote to Admin
- All changes logged for audit
- JWT authentication required
- Role validation on backend and frontend

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues

**Q: I don't see "Employee Management" section**
A: Make sure:
1. You're logged in with admin/hr account
2. You're on `/admin` page
3. Backend is running
4. Try refreshing page

**Q: Getting error "HR cannot assign admin role"**
A: This is expected! Only admins can promote to admin role.

**Q: Change didn't save**
A: Check:
1. Network tab for failed request
2. Backend logs for errors
3. Verify employee ID
4. Try again (might be network issue)
