## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Backend
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# 3. Check for errors
npm run lint

# 4. Test email service
npm run test:email  # (if available)
```

### Frontend
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build
npm run build

# 3. Verify no console errors
npm run dev
# Check browser console - should see NO React key warnings
```

## Environment Variables Check

### Backend (.env)
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=onyemechicaleb4@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=vapmmsbaootvgtau
FROM_EMAIL=kayode@go3net.com.ng
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173  # Update for production
```

### Frontend (.env)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Update for production
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment (Vercel/Production Server)
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder

# Verify environment variables are set on production server
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Vercel/Production Server)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder

# Update FRONTEND_URL in backend environment
```

### 3. Database (if needed)
- No migrations required
- No schema changes
- Existing data compatible

### Frontend
- [ ] Open Admin Dashboard → No React key warnings in console
- [ ] Open Employee Dashboard → No React key warnings
- [ ] Create task → Button shows loading spinner

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Frontend Rollback**: Revert to previous dist/ build
2. **Backend Rollback**: Revert to previous services (EmailService, TaskService, EmployeeService)
3. **No database rollback needed**

## Monitoring After Deployment

Check logs for:
```
✅ Task notification email sent successfully
✅ Department assignment email sent successfully
✅ Task completion notification email sent successfully

❌ Failed to send task notification email
❌ Failed to send department assignment email
```
