# 🔐 Employee Role Management System - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Employee Role Management System allows **Admin** and **HR** users to manage employee roles directly from the Admin Dashboard. This system enables role assignment, approval workflows, and employee lifecycle management all in one place.

---

## 📊 What Was Added

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **AdminEmployeeManagement.tsx** (700+ lines)
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/dashboard/AdminEmployeeManagement.tsx`

A comprehensive employee management component with:
- **Employee List Display** - Shows all employees with their current role and status
- **Search & Filter** - Filter by name, email, role (admin/hr/employee), or status (active/pending/rejected)
- **Expandable Employee Cards** - Click to see detailed information
- **Role Changer** - Easy-to-use buttons to change employee roles
- **Approval Workflow** - Approve or reject pending employees
- **Department Assignment** - Manage employee departments
- **Real-time Updates** - Uses React Query for live data synchronization

**Features:**
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Toast notifications for actions
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates

### Backend Updates

#### 1. **EmployeeService.ts** - Enhanced Role Management
```typescript
// NEW: HR can now update employee roles
if (currentUserRole === 'hr') {
  // HR can change roles but cannot promote to admin
  if (employeeData.role === 'admin') {
    throw new Error('HR cannot assign admin role');
  }
  // HR can update other employees
  const hrAllowedFields = ['fullName', 'department', 'position', ..., 'role'];
}
```

**Changes:**
- HR users can now update other employees' roles
- HR cannot promote themselves or others to admin
- HR can see all employees (including pending)
- Role changes are logged for audit

#### 2. **EmployeeController.ts** - Type Support
- Updated type definitions to include 'hr' role
- Added 'hr' to query parameter validation

#### 3. **employee.routes.ts** - Access Control
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only admin could manage employees
router.put('/:id', requireRole(['admin']), ...);

// AFTER: Admin AND HR can manage
router.put('/:id', requireRole(['admin', 'hr']), ...);
```

**Routes Updated:**
- `PUT /employees/:id` - Update employee (admin/hr)
- `GET /employees/pending` - See pending approvals (admin/hr)
- `GET /employees/stats` - View employee stats (admin/hr)
- `POST /employees/:id/approve` - Approve employee (admin/hr)
- `POST /employees/:id/reject` - Reject employee (admin/hr)
- `POST /employees/:id/department` - Assign department (admin/hr)

#### 4. **SupabaseEmployee.ts** - Model Updates
- Updated interfaces to support 'hr' role
- Added `role` to UpdateEmployeeRequest

### Employee → HR Promotion

```
1. Admin/HR selects employee

7. User now has HR permissions
```

**API Call:**
```javascript
PUT /api/employees/{employeeId}
{
  "role": "hr"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Employee updated successfully",
  "data": {
    "employee": {
      "id": "emp123",
      "fullName": "John Doe",
      "role": "hr",
      "status": "active",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Approval Workflow

2. Admin sees in "Employee Management"
3. Admin reviews employee details

5. Status changes to "active" or "rejected"
6. Email notification sent to employee
7. Employee can now login (if active)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (1 min)

The SQL migration `003_add_hr_role.sql` must be already executed. If not:

```sql
-- Add HR role to constraints
ALTER TABLE public.users 
DROP CONSTRAINT users_role_check;

ALTER TABLE public.users
ADD CONSTRAINT users_role_check 
CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'employee', 'hr'));

ALTER TABLE public.employees 
DROP CONSTRAINT employees_role_check;

ALTER TABLE public.employees
ADD CONSTRAINT employees_role_check 
CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'employee', 'hr'));
```

### Step 2: Backend Build & Deploy (5 min)

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
npm start
# or for Vercel: deploy automatically
```

**Key changes deployed:**
- ✅ EmployeeService.ts (role management logic)
- ✅ EmployeeController.ts (type support)
- ✅ employee.routes.ts (access control)
- ✅ SupabaseEmployee.ts (model updates)

### Step 3: Frontend Build & Deploy (5 min)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm start
# or for Vercel: deploy automatically
```

**New files deployed:**
- ✅ AdminEmployeeManagement.tsx
- ✅ Updated AdminDashboard.tsx

### Step 4: Testing (10 min)

**Test as Admin:**
1. Login with admin account
2. Go to `/admin` dashboard
3. Should see "Employee Management" section
4. Try searching for employees
5. Expand an employee card
6. Try changing role to HR
7. Verify toast notification appears
8. Verify employee list updates

**Test as HR:**
1. Create/promote an employee to HR role
2. Login with HR account
3. Go to `/admin` dashboard
4. Should see "Employee Management" section
5. Try changing another employee's role to HR
6. Try to promote to Admin → Should see error
7. Verify toast error: "HR cannot assign admin role"

**Test Edge Cases:**
- Search with term that returns no results
- Filter by role
- Expand/collapse multiple employees
- Rapid role changes
- Dark mode toggle

## 📊 Database Schema

The role changes are stored in the `employees` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees 
ADD COLUMN role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'employee'
CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'employee', 'hr'));

CREATE INDEX idx_employees_role ON employees(role);
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_role_status ON employees(role, status);
```

### Audit Trail

All role changes are logged:

```typescript
logger.info('Employee updated', {
  employeeId: id,
  updatedFields: ['role'],
  updatedBy: currentUserRole,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Role Management" section not showing

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're logged in with admin or HR account
2. Check that backend is running and accessible
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Try refreshing page

### Issue: Cannot change role

**Solution:**
1. Check your own role (must be admin or hr)
2. If HR, cannot change to admin (expected behavior)
3. Check network tab for API errors
4. Verify employee ID is correct

### Issue: Changes not persisting

**Solution:**
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify database migration was run
3. Check network for failed requests
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Issue: HR sees "Cannot assign admin role" error

**Solution:**
- This is expected! HR users cannot promote to admin
- Only admin can change someone to admin role
- HR can only assign HR or Employee roles

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- ✅ Uses React Query for caching
- ✅ Lazy loads employee data
- ✅ Implements pagination (5-50 employees per page)
- ✅ Debounced search input
- ✅ Memoized filtered lists

### Backend Optimization
- ✅ Indexed queries on role and status
- ✅ Pagination to reduce data transfer
- ✅ Role-based authorization (stops early if access denied)
- ✅ Cached employee list updates

### Expected Performance
- Page load: ~500ms
- Search: <100ms per keystroke
- Role change: 1-2 seconds (includes backend processing)
- Approve/Reject: 1-2 seconds
