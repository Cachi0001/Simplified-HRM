```
Super-Admin  →  Can see EVERY conversation (no restrictions)
Admin        →  Can see all EXCEPT super-admin personal chats
HR           →  Can see all EXCEPT super-admin personal chats  
Employee     →  Can see ONLY their own conversations
```

**But**: Anyone can SEND messages to anyone (DMs/Groups)

2. Buttons in top-right: 🌙 | 🔲 | X

## 🔧 Developer Notes

### Component Location
```
frontend/src/components/chat/FloatingChatWidget.tsx (430+ lines)
```

### Key New Code

**Viewport Bounds** (keeps bubble visible):
```typescript
const calculateBounds = () => ({
  left: 0, top: 0,
  right: window.innerWidth - 56,
  bottom: window.innerHeight - 56
});
```

**Fullscreen Toggle**:
```typescript
const [isFullscreen, setIsFullscreen] = useState(false);
```

**ESC Key Handler**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleEscKey = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Escape' && isFullscreen) {
      setIsFullscreen(false);
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleEscKey);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleEscKey);
}, [isFullscreen]);
```

**Role-Based Filtering**:
```typescript
const shouldShowChatInHistory = (chat, userRole) => {
  if (userRole === 'super-admin') return true;
  if (userRole === 'admin' || userRole === 'hr') {
    return !chat.name?.includes('super-admin-personal');
  }
  return true; // employees see their own (backend filters)
};
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Widget off-screen | Not possible - viewport constraint prevents it |
| ESC doesn't work | Only works in fullscreen mode, not normal view |
| History shows other people's chats | Backend isn't filtering - check API response |
| Buttons too small | Works on mobile (44px minimum touch target) |
| Can't see maximize button | It's in header between 🌙 and X |
| Dark mode changed dashboard too | No - widget has independent toggle |

## 📞 Need Help?

**Fullscreen not working?**
- Make sure you're in fullscreen mode to use ESC
- Click minimize button to toggle off

**History shows wrong chats?**
- Issue is backend not filtering
- Check `/api/chat/list?type=history` endpoint
- Verify role is being passed to backend

**Widget stuck in corner?**
- It's supposed to stay there! Drag it around but it won't go off-screen

**Mobile buttons too small?**
- Each button is 44px (touch-friendly)
- Larger than accessibility minimum
